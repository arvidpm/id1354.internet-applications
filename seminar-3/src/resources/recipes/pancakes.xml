		<title>Honey-Oatmeal Pancakes</title>

		<ingredient>
			<li>1/2 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups quick-cooking rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, slightly beaten</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons margarine or butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>Milk (optional)</li>
		</ingredient>

		<recipetext>
			<li>In a large mixing bowl combine whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. In another mixing bowl combine rolled oats and milk; let stand 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add the eggs, margarine or butter, and honey to the oak mixture. Beat until well combined. Add the oat mixture to the flour mixture. Stir just until combined but still slightly lumpy. (If batter is too thick, thin by adding milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.)</li>
			<li>Heat a lightly greased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat until a few drops of water dance across the surface. For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the hot griddle. Spread batter into a circle about 4 inches in diameter.</li>
			<li>Cook over medium heat until pancakes are golden brown, turning to cook the second sides when pancake surfaces are bubbly and edges are slightly dry (about 1 to 2 minutes per side).</li>
			<li>Serve immediately or keep warm in a loosely covered ovenproof dish in a 300 degree F oven. Makes 12 pancakes.</li>
